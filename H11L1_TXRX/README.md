# Optocoupler board for UART interface

The board is designed to isolate UART interfaces of two circuits using Schmitt Trigger Output Optocoupler with 1 MHz bandwidth. VA/GA and VB/GB form the pairs of VCC/GND of isolated circuits. The direction of signal is marked with arrow.

Besides the primary purpose of this board, it can be used for different applications: relay control, voltage-level converter, zero-cross detection, etc.

Part: H11L1SR2M (Fairchild/ONSemi).
